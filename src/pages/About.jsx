              since my childhood and fell in love with coding in July 2022. I found my passion in it and with
              the help of online resources and by coding projects on my own from scratch, I could gain a
              decent level of knowledge and skills in frontend web development.

            <h4>I am looking for a team</h4>
            <p>
              where I can create added value and from which I can learn a lot more than I could ever by
              building projects on my own. I am willing to challenge myself and to push my skills to the next
              level. I am 100% sure my passion and intrinsic motivation will help me on that way.

              due to my previous jobs. I know how to think economoically, analytical and customer centric. I
              even dedicated my thesis to customer relationship management and its effect on customer
              satisfactory.
