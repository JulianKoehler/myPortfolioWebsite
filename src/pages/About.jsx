            <h4>I am burning for computers</h4>
            <p>
              since my childhood and fell in love with coding in July 2022. I found my passion in it and with
              the help of online resources and by building my own projects, I could gain a decent level of
              knowledge and skills in frontend web development.

          <div className="aboutme-item-container">
            <h4>I am looking for a team</h4>
            <p>
              where I can create added value and from which I can learn a lot more than I could ever by
              building projects on my own. I am willing to challenge myself and to push my skills to the next
              level.

            <h4>I am a cat guy</h4>
            <p>
              who likes to spend time with his two male cats Floki and Bounty. I also really enjoy being
              outside in nature, going for a run or hitting the gym. I am keen about staying healthy and to
              also push myself in terms of physical fitness.

              to chase your dreams and do what you love. I never felt a drive like this when doing things. I
              want to be part of the ever evolving Tech-industry to drive digitilization and solve problems.
