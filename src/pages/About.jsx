              since my childhood and fell in love with coding in June 2022. I found my passion in it and with
              the help of online resources and by coding projects on my own from scratch, I gained a decent
              level of knowledge and skills in frontend web development.

            <h4>Now I am looking for a team</h4>
            <p>
              where I can create added value and from which I can learn a lot more than I could ever by
              building projects on my own. I am willing to challenge myself and to push my skills to the next
              level. I am 100% sure my passion and intrinsic motivation will help me on that way.

              to chase your dreams and do what you really love. After my graduation from school I went for a
              job in business administration at a big automotive supplier but soon my personal interests moved
              to computers and I envied people that are working in this area. I dedicated my entire free time
              to get to where I am now: Ready for my first job as a Front-End Developer.
